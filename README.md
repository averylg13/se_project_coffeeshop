## Plan on improving the project

While the design of this website is complete and mostly functional, there are still some improvements that can be added to make the site more dynamic. Such improvements would include adding a google/apple maps link to the company address so users can map the coffee shop location direcly from the site. Another can be rounding off the corners of the form inputs so it can look more visually pleasing and entice users to make a reservation. Another can be adding page links to all the menu items that would include nutritional facts and pictures so users can have more information about the food/drinks that are served. These are some small improvements but they can have a meaningful impact on the overall website experience.
